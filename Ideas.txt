1. precompute 2*n - 1
2. is it problem that graph has symmetric edges?





------------------------------- docs -------------------------------
1. choose vertex with highest degree as start
2. make the tree rooted at the start.
3. order rest of vertices. the ordering must satisfy the condition that when a vertex
is chosen for assignment, its parents have already been assigned. this is easier to implement,
easier to compute and prunes a bigger portion of the search space.
4. test with different kind of orders (bfs, dfs, ...)
5. choose an ordering of values for variables that is most likely to lead to a solution.
